# BepiTBR
Improved B cell epitope prediction using T cell-based prediction
## Introduction
The ability to predict B cell epitopes from antigen sequences is critical for biomedical research and many clinical applications. However, despite substantial efforts over the past 20 years, the performance of even the best B cell epitope prediction software is still modest. Based on the idea of T-B reciprocity, BepiTBR is a proof of concept B cell epitope prediction model that demonstrates improved performance by incorporating CD4+ T cell epitope prediction.
